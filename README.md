# surfs_up

## Overview of surfs_up
### Purpose
    The purpose of the challenge is to extract data from sqlite and then parse it to jupyter notebook in order to 
    transform the data and figure out if there are trends, or any importan patterns in a specific instance. In addition
    The challenge utilized some data visualization with Flask, in which we had to set up a route as well as define functions
    that will help determine what will appear on screen for Flask.
### Results
    Through extracting data from both June and December from the hawaii sqlite dataset, there are many conclusions that can be infered.
    *The June temperature averages are higher compared to the December temperature averages by about 3.9.
    *There are a total of 1700 datasets for June and there are 1517 datasets for December.
    *June Temperatures exceed the December Temperatures in every factor when describing the statstical data set(count,mean,min,max,25%,50%,75% quartile)
    
    
### Surfs_Up Summary
    Based off of the results of the dataset we can see that June Temperatures are higher by all accounts compared to the December dataset, 
    and therefore, the ice cream sales, as well as the number of people potentially going to the surf shop, due to the weather being more 
    warm. This will give incentive for more customers to buy ice cream in order to relax and cool off from the sun, and ride some waves to
    have fun. December may still have a considerable amount of people buying ice cream and surfing as it is not completely cold in some instances,
    but just expect more activity in the June area. Two additional queries to gather specific data for June and December Months, may be to gather more
    data from different stations, as there may be different areas in Hawaii that may be hotter, or colder. This way if W.Avy is willing, he can branch out 
    to different areas in hawaii based on the station's measurement for temperature around the area. In addition we can also measure the precipitation of 
    Hawaii in order to get the feel of the fog density around the area, as it can affect sight and less people may want to surf when the precipitation is not
    good for surfing in many days.
